FirstTest
===========

To test that the cofiguration for the 3208Clock board in the Arduino IDE is working please solder a LED and a resistor to the board like in the picture below.

The needed parts are a LED and a resistor with a value between 330 Ohm and 1500 Ohm. In this example I've used a 1kOhm (1000 Ohm) resistor.
