Simple Countdown
===========

The file Murat.ino contains a simple countdown timer which actuates an relay after the countdown.
The hardware which I used for this is one of these 3208 Clocks. Just go to Banggood.com or DX.com and type "3208" into the search field and you can't miss it.

Check out my web blog for more details about the hardware and how it can be programmed.
